* TODO mailers.py: add support for SSL connections
* TODO version number: how to automatically handle the version number from git tags, in all working cases?
  e.g. when mailtom is installed, we no longer have access to git
  info. The version string should be stored somewhere at build/install
  time.  

  Maybe using a file 'version.txt' that comes as a dependency of
  mailtom?
